# 🧠 Depression Classification Using Machine Learning

## 📋 Project Overview
This project focuses on **classifying depression levels** using machine learning techniques based on structured psychological data.  
It includes **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to understand data patterns and build an accurate predictive model.

The final model is based on **Support Vector Classifier (SVC)** and achieved an accuracy of approximately **97%**, indicating strong performance and reliability.

## 🎯 Project Objectives
- Analyze depression-related data using EDA
- Identify key features influencing depression classification
- Train and evaluate machine learning models
- Select the best-performing classification model
- Save the trained model for future deployment
